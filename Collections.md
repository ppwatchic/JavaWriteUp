##Java Collections Summary

A good understanding of members of Collections and their internal implementation mechanisms, helps in the design and algorithms related 
problems. 

####Section 1. Application Scenarioes
####Section 2. Diff 
####Section 3. Features 

Let's walk through the above mentioned sections. 

###Section 1. Application Secnarioes
*1.1 Set/HashSet*   
There is no duplicate elements in a Set/HashSet. Assuming you are counting how many departments in a specific company, you won't want to 
count the R&D department twice. Using Set/HashSet to can avoid having same elements in your result.   
1.2 List/ArrayList

###Section 2. Diff
*1.1 Queue/LinkedList/ArrayDeque*  
Queue can be implemented as ArrayDeque or LinkedList.
