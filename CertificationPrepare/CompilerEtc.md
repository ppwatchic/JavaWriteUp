## Javap
Javap stands for Java Printer, which is used to disassemble one or more .class files.  
Assume we have a `A.class` in a folder, and we can run `javap -c A.class` in command line when located in this folder to see the bytecode.   
We can use javap A.class` to see the disassemble code. 

## Java
To run a MyClass.class file in a folder foo, use `java foo.MyClass` in the bin folder.
