## Final method in a super class
Note: A final method in a super class can not be hiden, override from a subclass.   
There will be a compilation error if do so as shown in the code snippet:   
```
class Super {
  public final int getNext(int i) {
    return i++;
  }
}

class Sub extends Super {
  public int getNext(int i) { // Error, can only fix by remove final from Super class
    return i++;
  }
}
```  

## Method Signature
> Note: Definition: Two of the components of a method declaration comprise the method signatureâ€”the **method's name** and the **parameter types**.

## Final in method parameters
A `final` modifier on a method parameter is not mentioned in the rules for matching signatures of overridden methods, and it has **no effect** on the caller, only within the body of an implementation. Alsothe final modifier on a method parameter has no effect on the generated byte code. (This is not true for other uses of final.)
