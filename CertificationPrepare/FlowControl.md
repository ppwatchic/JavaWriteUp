## Switch statement
1. [A switch](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html) works with the **byte, short, char, and int** primitive data types. 
It also works with **enumerated types** 
(discussed in Enum Types), the **String class**, and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types: Character, 
Byte, Short, and Integer (discussed in Numbers and Strings).  
Thus you know, **long/double/float** will not be supported. 
2. You don't have to put `default` as the last statement in the `switch()` block. 

## Switch-Case expression
Case expression must be constant.
